#     useful in identifying the machine such that the community is aware of the
#     status of PSI/J on it.
#

#     A random string that is persisted on disk (in ~/.psij).

# The scope selects which branches get tested. This selection can potentially
# impact security. The options are:
#
# stable:
#     Only test stable branches (currently the main branch). The stable
#     branches are branches in the core repository which are considered stable
#     and have been extensively reviewed and tested on other machines. They
#     carry the lowest risks.
#
# core:
#     Test all core branches. This tests all stable branches, as above, and
#     all branches that are in the core namespace and are part of pull
#     requests. Since only core developers can create branches in the core
#     namespace, this limits the tested code to code written by core
#     developers.
# tagged:
#     Test all core branches and all branches that are part of pull requests
#     that have been explicitly tagged by core developers for testing. The
#     branches can exist in private namespaces, so, technically, anybody can
#     submit such pull requests. However, a core developer needs to explicitly
#     approve testing on such pull requests. This option carries the most
#     risks.

# Enables minimal uploads mode. In minimal mode, no information that is 
# potentially sensitive is uploaded to the test results server. Specifically, 
# only the following are uploaded:
#   - code related identifiers, such as branch names, class names, etc.
#   - times and dates
#   - test related identifiers, such as run id
#   - the maintainer email, if one is provided
#   - boolean values, such as whether the target system has mpirun available,
#     etc.
#   - git identifiers and counts: branch name, last commit hash, how many 
#     commits the local code has ahead/behind of the remote, and if there
#     are any local changes
#   - the result status of tests, excluding string error messages coming from
#     tests
#
# Excluded items include, but are not limited to:
#   - stdout/stderr from tests
#   - logs from tests
#   - filesystem paths
#
# The full information is still saved locally and can be accessed and manually
# vetted if required. Setting this to "true" automatically enables saving of
# results to files. Please note that this option modifies the behavior of 
# uploads, which must still be requested using the "--upload-results" flag.

# Which executors to test. This is a comma separated list of
# <executor_name>[:<launcher_name>[:<url>]] items. The "auto_q" executor means
# that the testing infrastructure will attempt to determine which queuing system
# is present on the test machine and use the corresponding executor for testing.
# Similar to "auto_q", "auto_l" means that the testing infrastructure will
# determine an appropriate launcher for the system. The launcher name can be
# empty if a particular executor does not use launchers but uses URLs
# (e.g., saga::localhost). The special value "auto" (without quotes) means that
# the executors to be tested should be determined automatically based on a
