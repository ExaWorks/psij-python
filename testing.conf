# An identifier for this site which will appear in the aggregated results which

#
# hostname:
#     The host name of the machine on which the tests are invoked. This is 
#     useful in identifying the machine such that the community is aware of the
#     status of PSI/J on it.
#
# random:
#     A random string that is persisted on disk (in ~/.psij).

# "<string>":
#     A user-specified string. Must be surrounded by double quotes.

# The scope selects which branches get tested. This selection can potentially 
# impact security. The options are:
# 
# stable: 
#     Only test stable branches (currently the main branch). The stable 
#     branches are branches in the core repository which are considered stable 
#     and have been extensively reviewed and tested on other machines. They 
#     carry the lowest risks.
#
# core:
#     Test all core branches. This tests all stable branches, as above, and 
#     all branches that are in the core namespace and are part of pull 
#     requests. Since only core developers can create branches in the core
#     namespace, this limits the tested code to code written by core 
#     developers.
# tagged:
#     Test all core branches and all branches that are part of pull requests
#     that have been explicitly tagged by core developers for testing. The 
#     branches can exist in private namespaces, so, technically, anybody can
#     submit such pull requests. However, a core developer needs to explicitly
#     approve testing on such pull requests. This option carries the most
#     risks.

# Which executors to test. This is a comma separated list of 
# <executor_name>[:<launcher_name>[:<url>]] items. The "auto_q" executor means 
# that the testing infrastructure will attempt to determine which queuing system 
# is present on the test machine and use the corresponding executor for testing.
# Similar to "auto_q", "auto_l" means that the testing infrastructure will 
# determine an appropriate launcher for the system. The launcher name can be
# empty if a particular executor does not use launchers but uses URLs 
# (e.g., saga::localhost)

# A key authenticates a test ID such that it reduces the odds that two machines
# compete to overwrite each other's results. The machines are identified by their
# IDs. However, without additional steps, any other test deployment can set its
# ID to an existing one. The "key" setting allows a secret to be used to 
# authenticate requests. There are two valid values:
# 
# random:
#     Generates a random key on the first upload attempt. The server will then
#     only accept subsequent requests from the same ID if the key matches. There
#     is a 7 day expiration of a pairing which allows for a new key to be used 
#     if an old key has not been used for 7 or more days. Random keys are 
#     persisted locally in ~/.psij
