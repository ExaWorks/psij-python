How to Contribute
-----------------

PSI/J welcomes all who wish to contribute, whether that means adding new features,
fixing typos, reporting/fixing bugs, or writing documentation. Use the
`GitHub repo <https://github.com/ExaWorks/psij-python>`_
to create issues and pull requests. Please follow the
`contributing guide <https://github.com/ExaWorks/psij-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

Please note that many high-level design questions may be better discussed in
the `PSI/J design repo <https://github.com/ExaWorks/job-api-spec>`_, rather than the Python library implementation
linked to above.

Feel free to chat with the developers on our `Slack <https://exaworks.slack.com>`_!


Running the Tests
-----------------

Once you have cloned the code and installed the dependencies
(``pip install -r requirements-dev.txt``), you can run the test
suite with ``make tests``. To run the style and type checks, run
``make checks``.

The testing dashboard website
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To record your test results to PSI/J's public testing dashboard,
and to schedule the test suite to run automatically on a timer,
see the
`testing README <https://github.com/ExaWorks/psij-python/blob/main/README-testing.md>`_.


Building the Documentation
--------------------------

See the instructions in the
`README <https://github.com/ExaWorks/psij-python/blob/main/README-dev.md>`_.
