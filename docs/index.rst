Portable Submission Interface for Jobs (PSI/J) - Python Library
===============================================================

This is a Python library that contains the core implementation of  `the
PSI/J specification
<https://exaworks.org/job-api-spec/specification>`_ as well as a
number of executors and launchers, which are the components that allow
PSI/J to communicate with specific job schedulers. Currently supported
schedulers include Slurm, LSF, Flux, PBS Pro, and Cobalt.
