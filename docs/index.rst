===============================================================

This is a Python library that contains the core implementation of  `the PSI/J specification
<a href="https://exaworks.org/job-api-spec/specification>`_ as well as a number of executors and launchers, which are the components that allow PSI/J to communicate with specific job schedulers, such as Slurm or LSF.
