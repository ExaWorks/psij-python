# Portable Submission Interface for Jobs

PSI/J is an abstraction layer over cluster schedulers to write scheduler agnostic HPC applications. PSI/J automatically translates abstract job specifications into concrete scripts and commands to send to the scheduler. PSI/J is tested on a wide variety of clusters. For further information about [PSI/J](https://exaworks.org/job-api-spec/) or the [SDK](https://github.com/ExaWorks/SDK) visit the [ExaWorks](https://exaworks.org/) project page and read the [PSI/J documentation](https://exaworks.org/psi-j-python/#docs).
