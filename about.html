                            <h2>The motivation behind <span class="psij-font">PSI/J</span></h2>

                            <p>
                                The <a href="exaworks.org">ExaWorks</a> project is a community-led project
                                under the umbrella of the <a href="exascaleproject.org">Exascale Computing
                                    Project</a> which brings together a number of high level HPC tools developed
                                by the members of ExaWorks. We noticed that most of these projects, as well as
                                many of the community projects, implemented a software layer/library to interact
                                with HPC schedulers in order to insulate the core functionality from the
                                details of how things are specified for each scheduler. We also noticed that
                                the respective libraries were mostly limited to schedulers running on resources that
                                each team had access to. We used our combined knowledge to
                                design a single API/library for this goal, one that would be tested on all
                                resources that all ExaWorks teams have access to. We then shared this API
                                and library so that all high level HPC tools can benefit from it.

                            <h2>The complexity of testing HPC libraries</h2>

                            <p>
                                A major difficulty in maintaining HPC software
                                tools is that access to HPC resources is generally limited to a small number
                                of clusters local to each team. Additionally, HPC resources vary
                                widely depending on the institution that maintains them. Consequently,
                                software that is tested on resources that a HPC tool development
                                team has access to is likely to encounter problems on other HPC resources. A first step in addressing this problem is by
                                pooling teams' respective resources for testing purposes.
                                <span class="psij-font">PSI/J</span> takes it a step further by exposing an
                                infrastructure that allows any user <span class="psij-font">PSI/J</span> user
                                to easily contribute test results to <span class="psij-font">PSI/J</span>,
                                and do so automatically. This is mutually beneficial: the
                                <span class="psij-font">PSI/J</span> community gains assurance that <span class="psij-font">PSI/J</span> functions correctly on
                                a wide range of resources, while users contributing tests have a mechanism to
                                ensure that the <span class="psij-font">PSI/J</span> team is aware of
                                potential problems specific to their resources and can address them, thus
                                ensuring that <span class="psij-font">PSI/J</span> continues to function
                                correctly on those resources.

                                offering a consistent representation of jobs and of the capabilities required
                                to submit them to the resources.
                                <a href="https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.saga">RADICAL-SAGA</a>
                                implements a subset of the SAGA standard, exposing a homogeneous programming
                                interface to the batch systems of HPC and HTC resources, enabling job
                                submissions and file transfers across resources. RADICAL-SAGA is used by
                                <a href="https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot">RADICAL-Pilot</a>
                                to acquire resources and staging data to and from HPC platforms.

                                The <span class="psij-font">PSI/J</span> API is in no small part inspired by

                                <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1271452">Abstraction API</a>.

                                The <a href="swift-lang.org">Swift</a> workflow system made extensive use of
                                and improved on the Java Cog Kit Abstraction API. While the original Swift
                                (Swift/K) is not maintained any more, its two spiritual successors,
                                <a href="http://swift-lang.org/Swift-T/">Swift/T</a> and
