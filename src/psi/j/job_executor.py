            This exception is fatal in that submitting another job with the exact same details will
            also fail with an `~psi.j.InvalidJobException`. In principle, the underlying

            reporting may come after a significant delay. In the interest of failing fast, library

            this exception as soon as possible if that validation fails.

        entirely possible for the job to complete before the cancelation is communicated to the
        underlying implementation and before the client code receives the completion notification.
        In such a case, the job will never enter the `CANCELED` state and
